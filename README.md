Deliverable 2 Instructions
The table could be inmproved by reorganizing the colomns and starting with countries as the first filter. It is best to start large and filter down. Starting
with cities is an akward approach. A second feature that could improve the website would be to have a download of the data tab so users could perform their 
own analysis.
